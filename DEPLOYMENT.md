# Deployment

You can find a deployment utility with hardhat to easily deploy the smart contracts locally or on our L16 test network,
if you don't have some LYX test token visit [LUKSO l16 Faucet](http://faucet.l16.lukso.network/), for faucet.

All the deployment scripts for `base` contracts initialize the contract after deployment to the zero address for security.

&nbsp;
## How to deploy on L16 with Hardhat?

1. write a private key for an address you control in the `hardhat.config.ts` file. For instance for L16 network:

```ts
    // public L16 test network
    luksoL16: {
      live: true,
      url: "https://rpc.l16.lukso.network",
      chainId: 2828,
      accounts: ["0xaabbccddeeff..."] // your private key here
    },
```

&nbsp;

2. run the command using one of the available `--tags`

```
npx hardhat deploy --network luksoL16 --tags <options> --reset
```

Available `--tags <options>` are:

- `UniversalProfile`: deploy a Universal Profile with the deployer as the owner.

- `UniversalProfileInit`: deploy + initialize (= lock) a Universal Profile as a base contract that can be used as implementation behind proxy.

- `LSP6KeyManager`: deploy a `UniversalProfile` + `KeyManager`, with the Universal Profile address linked to the Key Manager.     

- `LSP6KeyManagerInit`: deploy + initialize (= lock) both a `UniversalProfileInit` + `KeyManagerInit`, as base contracts (**NB:** the Key Manager will be initialized with reference to `address(0)`).   

- `LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP`: deploy a Universal Receiver Delegate contract that can be used to register assets and vaults received by a Universal Profile.

- `LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateVault`: deploy a Universal Receiver Delegate contract that can be used to register assets received by a LSP9Vault.

- `LSP7Mintable`: deploy a `LSP7Mintable` contract (Token), using the deployer address as the owner and allowing this deployer address to then mint tokens. The `isNFT_` parameter is set to `false`, making the token divisible.

- `LSP8Mintable`: deploy a `LSP7Mintable` contract (NFT), using the deployer address as the owner and allowing this deployer address to then mint tokens.

- `LSP7MintableInit`: deploy + initialize (= lock) a `LSP7MintableInit` contract (Token), that can be used as implementation behind proxy. The base contract is deployed with the `isNonDivisible_` parameter set to `false`, making the implementation token divisible.

- `LSP8MintableInit`: deploy + initialize (= lock) a `LSP8MintableInit` contract, that can be used as implementation behind proxy.

- `LSP9Vault`: deploy a `LSP9Vault` contract with the deployer as the owner.

- `LSP9VaultInit`: deploy + initialize (= lock) a `LSP9VaultInit` contract that can be used as implementation behind proxy.


- `standard`: deploy the 4 standard contract above.

- `base`: deploy the 4 base contract above (for proxy use)

&nbsp;

**Examples**

```
// Deploy the 3 contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network luksoL16 --tags standard --reset


// Deploy the 3 contracts as base contracts (to be used behind proxies)
npx hardhat deploy --network luksoL16 --tags base --reset

// Deploy a specific contract
npx hardhat deploy --network luksoL16 --tags UniversalProfile --reset
```

## Verify Contracts on L16

We recommend using [`@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan) plugin to verify the lsp-smart-contracts deployed on L16 network.

###Â 1. add the LUKSO L16 network in your hardhat config under `etherscan`

In your hardhat config file, under the `etherscan` property, add the following configurations for the [LUKSO L16 network](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/l16-testnet/parameters).

```js
etherscan: {
    // no API is required to verify contracts
    // via the Blockscout instance of L16 network
    apiKey: "no-api-key-needed",
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "luksoL16",
        chainId: 2828,
        urls: {
          apiURL: "https://explorer.execution.l16.lukso.network/api",
          browserURL: "https://explorer.execution.l16.lukso.network/",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
```

### 2. run `npx hardhat verify`.

See the following commands below for examples.

```bash
# verify a Universal Profile
npx hardhat verify <address of the deployed Universal Profile> "profile-owner" --network luksoL16 --contract path/to/UniversalProfileContract.sol:ContractName

# verify a Key Manager
npx hardhat verify <address of the deployed Key Manager> "address-of-UP-linked-to-KM" --network luksoL16

# verify the Universal Receiver Delegate of a UP
npx hardhat verify <address of the deployed URD> --network luksoL16

## Verify a LSP8 contract
npx hardhat verify <address of the LSP8 contract> "token-name" "token-symbol" "owner-address" --network luksoL16

## Verify a LSP9 contracts
npx hardhat verify <address of the LSP9 contract> "vault-owner" --network luksoL16
```

For base contracts (to be used as implementation behind proxies), the same commands can be used without the constructor arguments.

For LSP7 contracts, the constructor arguments provided to the command must be passed via a separate file. You can also use an external file for the arguments when verifying other contracts as well.

```bash
npx hardhat verify <address of the LSP7 contract> --constructor-args arguments.js --network luksoL16
```

```js title="arguments.js"
module.exports = [
    '<token-name>',  
    '<token-symbol>', 
    '<owner-address>', 
    false // isNonDivisible_ (true or false)
];

```
